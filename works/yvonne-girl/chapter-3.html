        <p class="drop-cap">The seatbelt cut into my chest wrong.</p>
<p>That was my first thought pulling into the reserved parking space I&#39;d earned through seven years of eating shit and calling it caviar. The belt pressed into the valley between foam padding, a valley that hadn&#39;t existed yesterday, creating pressure that reminded me with every breath that nothing about today was going to be the same.</p>
<p>I turned off the engine and sat for a moment, gathering courage, watching my breath fog the windshield in the January cold. Through the windshield, the Capitol building loomed in the gray morning, its dome disappearing into low-hanging clouds that promised more sleet. Five thousand times I&#39;d made this drive. Never like this.</p>
<p>I grabbed the purse Casey had insisted on-&quot;you can&#39;t carry a briefcase with that outfit&quot;-and opened the car door.</p>
<p>The first challenge hit immediately. Getting out of a car in a dress and heels required planning I&#39;d never considered. The skirt wanted to ride up, the heels made finding purchase on the concrete tricky, and the restrictive body shaper limited my flexibility, making every movement feel constrained and unfamiliar.</p>
<p>By the time I stood beside my car, I was already exhausted. And I hadn&#39;t even made it to the building.</p>
<p>The conservative navy blue sheath dress Casey had pulled from her own closet clung to my artificially curved body like evidence of a crime I was still committing. The satin lining slid against my chemically smoothed legs-a constant reminder that every inch of my femininity was crafted, applied, or padded into existence.</p>
<p>Walking towards the front door, the dress moved wrong with every step. Where a suit jacket stayed put, this fabric shifted and swayed, requiring constant adjustment. The skirt hit just above my knees-professional length, Casey had assured me, but it felt like being wrapped in a flag of surrender.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Washington had worked the security desk for three years. Same nod every morning, same &quot;Morning, Mr. Cross,&quot; same disinterest in anything beyond his paycheck and benefits.</p>
<p>Today he looked at my ID like it was written in Sanskrit.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything alright, Jeff?&quot; My voice echoed across the empty lobby, the masculine tone immediately incongruous with my outward appearance. I saw Jeff flinch at the sound.</p>
<p>He looked from the ID to me, then back to the ID. I watched his brain try to reconcile the photo with the woman in the navy dress standing in front of him.</p>
<p>&quot;I-yes ma&#39;am. I mean-&quot; His face went through several shades of confusion before landing on embarrassment. &quot;Mr. Cross?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Same package, different packaging.&quot; I took back my ID, my arm clumsily bumping into my padded chest.</p>
<p>&quot;You look...&quot; Marcus searched for words that wouldn&#39;t get him fired. &quot;Nice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>I clicked past him in heels that had seemed manageable at 6 AM but now felt like medieval torture devices. As I walked past him into the building, I heard him mutter something that sounded like &quot;This job gets weirder every day.&quot;</p>
<p>Each step across the building&#39;s ornate lobby echoed off the marble with a sharp report that announced my approach before anyone could see me. My ankles wobbled with each step, muscles I&#39;d never used screaming protests.</p>
<p>The dress&#39;s pencil skirt forced my legs into a mincing gait, each step a calculated negotiation between maintaining dignity and not splitting the seam. My thighs chafed against each other.. By the time I reached the elevator, my calves were cramping and I understood why women complained about heels. Each step required concentration: heel, then toe, keeping my ankles steady on the three-inch heels Alex had insisted on.</p>
<p>&quot;You need the height,&quot; they&#39;d said when I had complained. &quot;It will give you more presence and authority.&quot;</p>
<p>Right. Because nothing said &quot;respect my authority&quot; quite like tottering around on three-inch heels. Maybe next they&#39;d suggest I carry my policy briefs in a bedazzled purse.</p>
<p>The executive wing was tomb-quiet at 7:45 AM. Just how I&#39;d planned it. Get in early, get to the conference room, don&#39;t let anyone see me until I was ready. Establish position before the rest of the senior staff arrived. Control the narrative by controlling the space.</p>
<p>As I turned the corner, movement in my peripheral vision made me reach up reflexively. Blonde hair. Right. The lace-front wig in a stylish bob felt like wearing someone else&#39;s scalp-expensive, convincing, and incessantly annoying. Alex had glued it down with the precision of a mortician, creating a hairline that would fool everyone who didn&#39;t look too closely.</p>
<p>Passing the polished brass doors leading to the governor&#39;s suite, I caught my reflection and stopped cold.</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption class="blog-post__caption">A stranger stared back from the reflection.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The stranger in the reflection had my eyes but not my face. Her blonde bob framed features I didn&#39;t recognize-foundation had smoothed my jaw into softer lines, contouring created cheekbones I&#39;d never possessed, and the precisely blended eyeshadow made my eyes appear larger, more feminine.</p>
<p>I shuddered, recalling the ordeal of applying it all. The mascara had been the worst-Alex approaching my eyes with those tiny brushes while I tried not to blink. The lipstick was subtle but unmistakably present-a coral shade that Alex had insisted complemented my skin tone.</p>
<p>I looked good, but wouldn&#39;t be fooling anyone who looked closely. My shoulders were still too broad, my jawline too strong despite the makeup&#39;s best efforts. The Adam&#39;s apple that Alex had tried to minimize with foundation and strategic contouring was still there if you knew where to look. But I looked good enough for my purposes today. The woman in the reflection looked competent, authoritative, and feminine enough to show the staff that I was in control of my own narrative, while also making Beau deeply uncomfortable with his own power games.</p>
<p>I made it to the conference room without seeing another soul. The space looked the same as always-mahogany table that could seat twenty, portraits of dead governors judging from the walls, windows overlooking the Capitol grounds. The constancy of my surroundings only served to highlight how different I felt.</p>
<p>I took my usual seat at the governor&#39;s right hand and began arranging briefing materials. Normal Tuesday morning prep. Budget revisions, legislative updates, the usual crises that kept the state lurching forward. Everything exactly as it would be if I hadn&#39;t spent the previous evening letting my deputy chief of staff&#39;s ex use my face as an experimental canvas.</p>
<p>At 8:15, footsteps echoed in the hallway. Janet Weiss appeared in the door, already reviewing budget projections because Janet never stopped working. She looked up, saw me, and froze like someone had hit pause on her entire existence.</p>
<p>&quot;Morning, Janet.&quot; I kept my voice level, professional.</p>
<p>Her mouth opened. Closed. Opened again. &quot;Evan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Coffee&#39;s fresh if you want some.&quot;</p>
<p>Janet entered the room like she was approaching a wild animal. Set her materials down carefully, eyes never leaving me. &quot;You look... different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Still me though. Did the education committee send their revised numbers?&quot;</p>
<p>Derek Holt arrived next, took one look at me, and immediately became fascinated by his phone screen-scrolling with the desperate intensity of someone pretending the Chief of Staff hadn&#39;t shown up in a dress and heels. When forced to make eye contact, he offered a pained smile and dove into his briefing notes like they contained nuclear launch codes.</p>
<p>Kevin Morrison walked directly into a chair.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; he mumbled to the furniture, then spent the next five minutes arranging papers that were already perfectly arranged while stealing glances at me like I might spontaneously combust.</p>
<p>By 8:50, I had a conference room full of senior staff performing an elaborate ballet of professional discomfort. Nobody knew how to react to their boss in a dress, so they&#39;d defaulted to hypercompetent busy work while shooting me sideways glances.</p>
<p>Casey finally entered carrying briefing folders, nodding to me like transforming the Chief of Staff into a woman was just another part of the job that she performed flawlessly every day.</p>
<p>&quot;The education committee moved their vote to this afternoon,&quot; she announced. &quot;We&#39;ll need revised talking points.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Already drafted,&quot; I replied, sliding a document across the table. The interaction was normal, no different than the thousands we&#39;d had before. I hoped that it would set the tone for the rest of the staff, but it was clear they were still unsure how to react to me.</p>
<p>I needed to clear the air. Take control.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay everyone, let&#39;s get started. But before we dive into budget revisions, we should address the elephant in the room.&quot; I said, pushing a strand of blonde hair behind my ear-a gesture that felt both habitual and alien. &quot;Or in this case, the Chief of Staff in a dress.&quot;</p>
<p>Nervous laughter rippled around the table. Derek&#39;s shoulders actually relaxed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday you all heard the Governor make some comments about my approach to crisis management being too... sensitive. So I thought I&#39;d lean into that feedback, just for today.&quot;</p>
<p>I adjusted my skirt with deliberate care. &quot;But everything that happened yesterday is old news. We&#39;re all still on the same team here. The Governor, all of us-we&#39;re here to serve the people of this state and make their lives better. That mission doesn&#39;t change because I&#39;m wearing a dress instead of a suit.&quot;</p>
<p>A few genuine chuckles around the table.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m still the same person who&#39;s been managing this administration. I just have better hair now.&quot; I gestured to the blonde bob. &quot;Now can we please get through this budget review before the Governor arrives and makes this really awkward?&quot;</p>
<p>The tension broke like a fever. Derek actually smiled. Janet relaxed enough to pour coffee. They were still processing, but the visceral discomfort was fading. I caught Casey&#39;s eye across the table, and she nodded to me as if to say, &quot;mission accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>This was exactly what I&#39;d hoped for-control the narrative, own the situation, show them it was no big deal and they&#39;d follow my lead. This was just another problem to solve through competent leadership.</p>
<p>&quot;Before we begin,&quot; I added, &quot;you should know that Tommy Danielson is no longer with the administration. Derek, you&#39;ll handle press duties until we find a replacement.&quot;</p>
<p>A few eyebrows rose-firing the Press Secretary would normally be bigger news, but today it barely registered against my sartorial transformation.</p>
<p>&quot;Moving on to budget revisions...&quot;</p>
                <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>For the next twenty minutes, everything flowed normally. I forgot about the dress, the heels, the wig. The staff forgot their initial shock. We were politicians doing political work, and clothing turned out to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>And then Beau arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry for the delay,&quot; he said, already scrolling through his phone. &quot;The Morgan family sends their regards and a truly obscene check for-&quot;</p>
<p>He looked up, registered my appearance, and stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p>Stopped walking.</p>
<p>Stopped breathing.</p>
<p>For the first time in seven years, I watched Beauregard Fenstemaker III genuinely speechless.</p>
<p>His eyes moved slowly from my blonde hair to the navy dress to the obvious swell of my padded chest, then back to my carefully made-up face. I watched his brain short-circuit as it tried to process his male Chief of Staff transformed into someone who looked like she belonged in any boardroom.</p>
<p>&quot;Governor,&quot; I said evenly. &quot;Shall we begin with the budget revisions?&quot;</p>
<p>My voice seemed to restart his brain, but not well.</p>
<p>&quot;I-yes. Of course. The budget.&quot; He took his seat carefully, like the chair might explode.</p>
<p>For the next fifteen minutes, I thought I had already won. Beau struggled through the budget discussion, clearly rattled by my transformation. He kept losing his train of thought, stealing glances at me like I might suddenly reveal this was all an elaborate prank. I expected that we&#39;d have it out after the meeting, he&#39;d concede, and things would go back to normal.</p>
<p>But then something started shifting. I watched Beau gather himself, pulling his aristocratic bearing back on like armor. When he looked at me again, his eyes had gone calculating.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt this fascinating budget discussion, but I think we should acknowledge your rather dramatic change.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What change would that be?&quot; I kept my voice professionally neutral, but inside I was singing. He was completely off-balance. Seven years I&#39;d watched Beau navigate every situation with unbroken confidence, and now he looked like a malfunctioning robot.</p>
<p>&quot;Your...&quot; He gestured vaguely at all of me. &quot;This. This is quite unexpected.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it?&quot; I folded my hands on the table, noting how the pink nail polish caught the light. Casey&#39;s addition. &quot;Are you suggesting there&#39;s something unprofessional about how women dress?&quot;</p>
<p>The trap was effective but maybe too obvious. Criticize my appearance and he&#39;d be attacking women&#39;s professional attire.</p>
<p>I watched him calculate options, working through angles. Around the table, staff members found fascinating things to study in their coffee cups and briefing materials.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not,&quot; he said finally. &quot;You look very professional.&quot;</p>
<p>Got him.</p>
<p>&quot;But you know,&quot; he continued, &quot;I have to say I&#39;m impressed by your commitment, Evan.&quot;</p>
<p>Every political instinct I&#39;d developed screamed danger.</p>
<p>&quot;Commitment?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I do hope this isn&#39;t just for today.&quot; His smile had edges now. &quot;That would be rather insulting, wouldn&#39;t it? Using gender presentation as a costume?&quot;</p>
<p>The room went very still.</p>
<p>&quot;After all,&quot; Beau continued, voice taking on the reasonable tone that meant he was about to fuck someone over, &quot;we have transgender staff members. Members of our community who live their authentic truth every day. To treat their reality as something you can put on and take off to win an argument with me...&quot;</p>
<p>He let the implication hang in the air like a noose.</p>
<p>&quot;That would be mockery, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; He leaned back in his chair, completely in control now. &quot;So I have to ask-is this authentic expression, or are you treating gender identity as some sort of stunt?&quot;</p>
<p>The trap was perfect. Admit it was temporary and I&#39;d be confessing to using trans identity as a costume. Claim it was authentic and I&#39;d be locked into dresses indefinitely.</p>
<p>I felt sweat gather under the wig despite the January draft.</p>
<p>How had I not seen this coming? I&#39;d been so focused on beating Beau at this bizarre game that I&#39;d never stopped to consider what this would look like to everyone else. What it would appear to be. I&#39;d thought I was making a clever strategic point about his sexist bullshit, but to the outside world-to transgender people, to anyone with basic human decency-it would look like I was treating gender as a costume. A prop in my political theater. I&#39;d been so consumed with winning the argument that I&#39;d completely missed how offensive the whole performance actually was.</p>
<p>My only play was obvious. He&#39;d backed me into a corner where retreat meant admitting I&#39;d mocked transgender identity for sport. But corners were where trapped animals became most dangerous. If Beau wanted authentic femininity, I&#39;d give him enough to choke on while I figured out my next move.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m exploring my presentation,&quot; I said carefully, trying to find an exit that didn&#39;t exist. &quot;Understanding what it means to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exploring?&quot; Beau&#39;s eyebrows rose with theatrical surprise. &quot;That sounds rather noncommittal.&quot;</p>
<p>He leaned forward like a prosecutor approaching a hostile witness. &quot;Either you&#39;re presenting as a woman because that&#39;s who you are, or you&#39;re playing dress-up. Which is it?&quot;</p>
<p>Every face around the table turned to me. Waiting. I could feel the walls closing in, the careful strategy crumbling under Beau&#39;s counterattack.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my authentic presentation,&quot; I heard myself say through gritted teeth, the lipstick making my mouth feel foreign as I spoke the words that would lock me into this performance.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s so nice to hear,&quot; Beau smiled like a shark scenting blood. &quot;We should probably update your personnel files. Get you a new ID badge with a photo that matches. Make sure the staff directory reflects your preferred presentation.&quot;</p>
<p>Each suggestion tightened the noose. He was systematically closing every exit, making it harder to back down.</p>
<p>&quot;That seems premature-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does it? I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to think we&#39;re not fully supportive.&quot; He turned to Joan, his assistant. &quot;Make a note. We&#39;ll need to ensure all of Evan&#39;s official documents reflect... actually, that raises a question.&quot;</p>
<p>Here it came. The killing blow.</p>
<p>&quot;&#39;Evan&#39; seems rather masculine for your current presentation. Evvvannn.&quot; He drew out my name, tasting it. &quot;Sends mixed signals, don&#39;t you think? If you&#39;re going to do this, you should do it properly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know&hellip;&quot; I shook my head in disbelief, the unfamiliar weight of hair moving against my neck a physical reminder of my situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh I&#39;m quite sure.&quot; He leaned forward, and I saw real enjoyment spark in his eyes for the first time. &quot;Eeeee-van. Yvonne. Yes, that&#39;s much better. French. Elegant. Appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>The name felt like a blade sliding between ribs-sharp, precise, and designed to leave me bleeding internally. Around the table, staff shifted uncomfortably, but no one spoke up. They were watching their Governor rename his Chief of Staff like a pet, and political survival meant staying silent. Any ground I&#39;d made up with them this morning had all been ceded back.</p>
<p>&quot;Yvonne,&quot; Beau repeated, and the satisfaction in his voice made me want to punch his perfect teeth out. The name settled around me like a shroud, obscuring thirty-four years of being Evan Cross.</p>
<p>&quot;But&hellip;,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;But nothing!&quot; His smile widened. &quot;If you&#39;re authentically presenting as a woman, you deserve a name that matches. Don&#39;t you think, everyone?&quot;</p>
<p>Forced participation. Make them all complicit. Around the table, my staff-people I&#39;d hired, mentored, fought for-shifted uncomfortably but tried to be supportive.</p>
<p>&quot;Yvonne is... a lovely name,&quot; Janet offered carefully, her voice tight with the effort of trying to do the right thing while clearly sensing something was wrong.</p>
<p>Derek nodded with obvious discomfort. &quot;Very professional sounding.&quot;</p>
<p>Kevin cleared his throat. &quot;If that&#39;s what you prefer, we&#39;re... we&#39;re supportive.&quot; The words came out stilted, like he was reading from a script on workplace inclusivity.</p>
<p>They could see my distress, but I&#39;d just told them this was my authentic presentation. What were they supposed to do-object to their boss&#39;s gender identity? Tell me my new name was inappropriate?</p>
<p>Their hesitant validation somehow made it worse than silence would have been.</p>
<p>&quot;Yvonne,&quot; Beau repeated, savoring his victory. &quot;Much more suitable. Now then, Yvonne, shall we continue with the budget?&quot;</p>
<p>And just like that, I&#39;d lost.</p>
<p>For the next twenty minutes, Beau used my new name at every opportunity. At first, he could barely contain his glee over my humiliation. But as the meeting progressed, the initial humor in his voice began to curdle. By the third &quot;What does Yvonne think about the infrastructure proposal?&quot; he wasn&#39;t meeting my eyes anymore.</p>
<p>By the fifth &quot;Yvonne makes an excellent point,&quot; his enthusiasm had turned into something else. He was still playing the game, but the fun had drained out of it.</p>
<p>He&#39;d wanted to humiliate me. Make me squirm. Instead, he was stuck in a meeting with his professionally dressed Chief of Staff who happened to be wearing a dress and answering to a woman&#39;s name. I expected the reality was less satisfying than the concept.</p>
<p>As the meeting continued, I watched Beau&#39;s enthusiasm for using my new name gradually fade. Each &quot;Yvonne&quot; came out with less satisfaction until he was practically forcing the syllables. By the time we reached infrastructure discussion, he was avoiding eye contact entirely, his discomfort growing more obvious with each passing minute.</p>
<p>He stood abruptly before we&#39;d even reached the end of the agenda, gathering materials with unusual haste. &quot;I have calls to make. Yvonne, I trust you&#39;ll maintain this... commitment. It would be awkward if this turned out to be temporary.&quot;</p>
<p>The threat was clear, but delivered without his usual relish. He left without waiting for a response, and I swear to God he was fleeing.</p>
<p>The room emptied quickly, staff escaping the awkwardness like the building was on fire. Only Casey remained, studying me with those dark eyes that missed nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said. &quot;That was interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>I slumped in my chair, not caring that the position made my padded chest jut out awkwardly. &quot;I&#39;m trapped. He fucking trapped me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You heard him. Either I keep this up or admit I was mocking trans people.&quot; I pulled off the heels with a groan of relief. My feet looked like they&#39;d gone ten rounds with a meat tenderizer. &quot;He won. I thought I was so clever, thought I&#39;d found his weakness, and he just...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But did you see his face?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the end. When he kept saying &#39;Yvonne&#39; but stopped enjoying it.&quot; Casey leaned back, a small smile playing at her lips. &quot;He thought humiliating you would be fun. Making you dress like a woman, renaming you, all his mind games-it was supposed to be this big power play.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It worked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did it? Because from where I sat, he looked miserable. He created this situation and now he has to live with it. See it every day. Interact with you like this in every meeting.&quot; Her smile widened. &quot;He thought he&#39;d break you. Instead, he&#39;s created a hostile work environment for himself.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought about it. The way his enthusiasm had faded. The early dismissal. The way he&#39;d stopped making eye contact after the first few &quot;Yvonnes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s as trapped as I am,&quot; I said slowly.</p>
<p>Casey sat back, satisfaction written across her face. &quot;More so. You have plausible deniability-exploring identity, authentic expression, whatever language you need. But he&#39;s the one who created this situation and now has to live with the consequences every single day.&quot;</p>
<p>A spark of hope flickered. &quot;So if I can outlast his discomfort...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly. He wants you to break first. To admit this was all a stunt so he can claim victory. But every day you show up looking like this is another day he has to manage his own discomfort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t keep wearing the same dress, hoping he&#39;ll break down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not.&quot; Casey&#39;s eyes glinted as she thought through the strategic angles. &quot;The smart play is escalation. Push his discomfort until he cracks. Unless you think you can&#39;t handle going more feminine?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More feminine how?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll figure it out. The question is whether you&#39;re willing to dig deeper to win.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought about my feet screaming in heels, about the bra digging into my ribs, about answering to &quot;Yvonne&quot; until Beau finally cracked. It could be days. Weeks, even.</p>
<p>But then I thought about Tommy&#39;s period joke. About all of my earned authority going up in flames because of some gendered jokes. About Beau thinking he could break me with panties and power plays.</p>
<p>&quot;I just want to go home and rip all this off,&quot; I admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Casey stood, all business now. &quot;You&#39;ll get through the day. Then you&#39;re coming to my place. Your body language is still too masculine. The way you sit, walk, gesture-it all screams &#39;man in a dress.&#39; If you&#39;re going to win this, you need to play it more femme.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Casey...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is what we do, Evan. Your father never backed down from a fight, did he? Even when the odds looked impossible.&quot;</p>
<p>My father. He&#39;d built his legend on never letting them see you sweat. But what would James Cross think of his son sitting in a dress and padded bra, answering to a woman&#39;s name?</p>
<p>Maybe he&#39;d think I was fighting with the weapons available. He&#39;d think I was adapting to the battlefield. He&#39;d think I was showing exactly the kind of creative problem-solving that had made him legendary.</p>
<p>Or maybe he&#39;d think I&#39;d lost my fucking mind.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
        <p>By five o&#39;clock, I felt like I&#39;d fought a war in three-inch heels and lost. I was exhausted, not just physically-though my feet screamed with every step-but emotionally drained from constant performance. Every movement required thought, every interaction needed careful navigation.</p>
<p>But at least the office was functioning again. Yesterday my staff had treated me like a dead man walking, routing decisions around me, canceling meetings, acting like my authority had evaporated. Today, despite the dress and the heels and answering to &quot;Yvonne,&quot; they were taking direction from me again. The power structure had snapped back into place. Ironically, Beau&#39;s over-the-top support for my &quot;transition&quot; had restored my standing with the staff-they couldn&#39;t undermine someone the Governor was publicly championing, even if the whole situation made them deeply uncomfortable.</p>
<p>My gambit had worked, just not the way I&#39;d intended. I&#39;d wanted to make Beau squirm. Instead, I&#39;d accidentally rebuilt my professional authority while trapped in a performance I couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
<p>I slipped off the heels with a groan of relief. My feet looked angry-red marks where the straps had cut in, blisters forming on my heels. The price of my power play, paid in pain and pride.</p>
<p>I was gathering my things when Casey appeared in my doorway. &quot;You survived,&quot; she said, lowering herself onto my couch.</p>
<p>&quot;Barely.&quot; I leaned back in my chair. The position made the hem of my dress ride up and my bra cut into my ribs. &quot;These shoes are actually evil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to womanhood.&quot; She joked. &quot;Painful shoes are just the beginning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do this every day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Practice. And lower heels.&quot; She sat across from me, studying my appearance with professional interest. &quot;You held up well, though. Better than I expected.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I felt like I was dying inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It didn&#39;t show. That&#39;s what matters. Don&#39;t forget-dinner at my place. We need to work on your presentation if you&#39;re determined to break Beau.&quot;</p>
<p>Right. More practice being Yvonne.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; I said, standing carefully on sore feet. &quot;But I&#39;m changing shoes first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have flats in my office. Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>As I followed Casey out, heels in hand, I caught my reflection in the conference room windows. The woman staring back looked tired but determined. Blonde hair slightly mussed, makeup holding up despite the stress, dress still professional despite a day of fighting in it.</p>
<p>She looked like someone who could outlast Beauregard Fenstemaker III.</p>
<p>Something about that thought should have been reassuring. Instead, it terrified me.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re thinking too hard,&quot; Casey said, looking back and seeing my expression. &quot;That&#39;s always been your problem.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? I thought my problem was thinking I could beat Beau at his own game.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re not playing his game. Not anymore.&quot; She stopped at her office door. &quot;The question is who breaks first-you or him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What if we both break?&quot;</p>
<p>Casey&#39;s smile was sharp as a blade. &quot;I&#39;m here to make sure that doesn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p>
<p>I followed her into her office, each step taking me further from the life I&#39;d known and deeper into an escalation I&#39;d started but couldn&#39;t stop. Tomorrow I&#39;d show up looking even more feminine, pushing Beau&#39;s discomfort to new heights. Tomorrow &quot;Yvonne&quot; would be more real than today.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#39;d dig my hole deeper and dare him to bury me in it.</p>
<p>The flats Casey handed me were a mercy my feet didn&#39;t deserve. But they were also pink, with little bows on the toes. Because apparently, the universe had decided subtlety wasn&#39;t in the cards for me today.</p>
<p>&quot;These are humiliating,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Get used to it.&quot; Casey was already texting someone-probably Alex, probably about tomorrow&#39;s escalation. &quot;Humiliation is just another emotion to master. Your father knew that.&quot;</p>
<p>My father had also never had to wear foam tits to work, but I took her point.</p>
<p>As we left the building together, I wondered what would be left of Evan Cross when this war finally ended. Whether winning would cost more than losing.</p>
<p>But those were tomorrow&#39;s problems. Tonight, I had to learn to sit like a lady.</p>
<p>Christ, my father would be so proud.</p>
