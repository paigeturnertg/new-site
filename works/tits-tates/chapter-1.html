        <p><strong>EPISODE 1: &quot;DISTRUST AND ESTATES&quot;</strong></p>
<p class="drop-cap">&quot;Tonight, at 8pm, the season premiere of &#39;The Tates&#39;! Two brothers, one inheritance, and a house full of memories they&#39;d both rather forget. Watch what happens when Alex, the bitter ad executive with two ex-wives bleeding him dry-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brad. Cut it out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;-moves in with Brad, the award-winning journalist turned blogger-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brad! Stop. Narrating. Our. Lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad Tate dropped the announcer voice. &quot;I&#39;m just setting the scene.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is real life, Brad. Real people. Real problems. Not a goddamn sitcom.&quot; Alex Tate stood in the doorway of their late parents&#39; living room wearing what an advertising creative director probably shouldn&#39;t wear to work: a wrinkled dress shirt that had given up somewhere around the third wearing, slacks that were fighting a losing battle against his midsection, and the general air of someone who&#39;d stopped trying to impress clients around the same time his second marriage ended.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re literally moving in together after our parents died,&quot; Brad said, gesturing with what might have once been a protein bar but was now mostly wrapper. &quot;That&#39;s the setup of every roommate sitcom ever made. I&#39;m Oscar, you&#39;re Felix-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not The Odd Couple.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s exactly The Odd Couple. You&#39;re uptight, I&#39;m relaxed. You&#39;re neurotic, I&#39;m-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slovenly? Sedentary? Stuck rewatching old sitcoms to avoid thinking about Hannah?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad winced. That one hit a little close. He&#39;d been &quot;working on his blog&quot; for three years now, ever since the Tribune had laid him off along with half the newsroom. The blog was about classic sitcoms and their cultural impact. It had seventeen regular readers.</p>
<p>&quot;See? You&#39;re already doing the Felix thing.&quot; Brad settled onto the couch, which exhaled a small cloud of dust and defeat. &quot;Give it two weeks and you&#39;ll be following me around with a vacuum cleaner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In two weeks, we&#39;ll have sold this place and gone our separate ways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why are you moving in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you&#39;re moving in. I&#39;m not letting you have the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Neither do I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you can&#39;t have it.&quot;</p>
<p>They stared at each other across the living room, which looked less like a home and more like a museum dedicated to the 1970s-specifically, the parts of the 1970s that even the 1970s were embarrassed about. Wood paneling the color of depression. Avocado green shag carpeting that had probably been white once, in theory. Furniture in earth tones that suggested the earth in question had given up and died. And there, hanging near the doorway like a textile nightmare, was an actual macram&eacute; owl. Their mother had loved that owl. Their mother had been wrong about the owl.</p>
<p>Brad swept his arm around the room with the enthusiasm of a game show host revealing a booby prize. &quot;Look at this place! It&#39;s like walking onto a sitcom set. Three&#39;s Company meets The Brady Bunch meets a thrift store having an existential crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you be serious for five minutes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tried that once. Didn&#39;t care for it.&quot;</p>
<p>The truth was grimmer than Brad&#39;s admission suggested, but only slightly.</p>
<p>The truth was that since Hannah died, Brad had been living inside classic sitcoms the way some people lived inside bottles. The plots were predictable. The conflicts resolved cleanly. Nobody got cancer. And if they did, it was a &quot;very special episode&quot; that ended with a hug and a lesson learned, not eighteen months of watching someone disappear.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, real life didn&#39;t care about Brad&#39;s coping mechanisms. Real life had bills and inheritance law and a brother he could barely tolerate.</p>
<p>Neither brother wanted to move in with the other. But neither of them could afford to buy out the other&#39;s fifty percent share.</p>
<p>Alex&#39;s salary as a creative director at McMann & Tate would have been plenty-he was good at his job, even if he&#39;d stopped caring about looking the part-but he was hemorrhaging money in alimony. Two ex-wives, two monthly checks, both of them living off his income like he was running a charity for divorced women.</p>
<p>He&#39;d tried everything to minimize the payments. Better lawyers. Loopholes. Arguments about how they were perfectly capable of supporting themselves if they just got off their asses and got jobs instead of depending on him to maintain their &quot;accustomed lifestyle.&quot; But family court had disagreed.</p>
<p>&quot;They could support themselves if they wanted to,&quot; he&#39;d told his second divorce lawyer. &quot;They&#39;re just lazy. They got comfortable depending on me, and now I&#39;m stuck paying for it.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyer had made a note and said nothing.</p>
<p>Brad made decent money too-or he had, back when newspapers existed as going concerns rather than elaborate suicide notes to journalism. Now he made whatever you could make from a blog with seventeen readers and the occasional freelance piece about &quot;10 Classic Sitcoms That Predicted Modern Life&quot; that paid forty-seven dollars and required two rounds of edits.</p>
<p>He&#39;d been coasting for three years, telling himself he was &quot;building his brand&quot; and &quot;establishing his voice&quot; when really he was watching Cheers and trying not to think about how Hannah used to make fun of his sitcom obsession right up until the cancer made it impossible for her to make fun of anything.</p>
<p>The real estate market was, to use the technical term, dogshit. The house needed work. The roof leaked. The electrical was from an era when people thought asbestos was a feature. And something was wrong with the foundation that made contractors suck air through their teeth before saying &quot;well, it&#39;s not technically condemned.&quot;</p>
<p>They were stuck with each other. In this house. In 1974, apparently, based on the d&eacute;cor.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll take the master bedroom,&quot; Alex announced, as if he&#39;d just claimed the last seat on a lifeboat.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll take the guest room.&quot; Brad didn&#39;t mention that the guest room was closer to the kitchen and the good TV. Let Alex have his victory.</p>
<p>________________</p>
<p>&quot;And so begins the cohabitation phase of our story. Two brothers, divided by rivalry, united by-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop narrating,&quot; Alex muttered as he carried a box past Brad three days later. Move-in day was already off to a rocky start.</p>
<p>&quot;You know,&quot; Brad said, &quot;you&#39;re getting that vein in your forehead. The one you always get when you&#39;re about to lecture me.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex shifted his box. &quot;At least I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s been wearing the same Cheers t-shirt for three days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There it is. Also, it&#39;s a different Cheers t-shirt. I have seven of them. It&#39;s called a wardrobe system.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s called you haven&#39;t done laundry since 2022.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s-&quot; Brad paused. &quot;Actually that might be accurate.&quot;</p>
<p>They stood in the hallway, boxes in arms, falling into the old tit-for-tat rhythm they&#39;d established somewhere around age eight and never quite broken. Brad takes a shot, Alex fires back, Brad counters, Alex responds. The bickering was almost comfortable. Familiar. Like putting on an old jacket that didn&#39;t fit anymore but you couldn&#39;t quite throw away.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re doing it again,&quot; Alex said after a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Doing what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The thing. The brother thing. Where we snipe at each other until one of us says something that actually hurts and then we don&#39;t talk for six months.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad shifted his box. &quot;We made it, what, ten minutes this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;New record.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we need rules,&quot; Brad said. &quot;Structure. A framework to prevent the inevitable spiral into fratricide.&quot;</p>
<p>They stood there for another moment, both knowing this was a terrible idea, both knowing they were going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Alex said. &quot;I&#39;ll find a roommate agreement. Something official. Legal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something that will keep us from killing each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or at least delay it until after we sell the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex pulled out his phone and started scrolling. &quot;Here. Same site I got my prenups from. Very thorough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How&#39;d those work out for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The prenups worked fine. The marriages were the problem.&quot; Alex kept scrolling. &quot;I got screwed anyway, but at least the prenups limited the damage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit. Real romantic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Romance is for people who haven&#39;t been divorced twice.&quot; Alex found what he was looking for and shoved his phone at Brad. &quot;Just sign it.&quot;</p>
<p>The screen showed a PDF titled &quot;Roommate Dispute Resolution Agreement&quot; with a clipart image of two people shaking hands in front of a house. Forty-seven pages of dense legal text in what appeared to be 8-point font, single-spaced, the kind of document designed to make your eyes glaze over somewhere around paragraph two.</p>
<p>Brad scrolled through it for approximately thirty seconds-long enough to see words like &quot;heretofore&quot; and &quot;party of the first part&quot; and &quot;remediation procedures&quot;-before his brain declared bankruptcy and he scrawled his signature with his finger.</p>
<p>&quot;There. Happy?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex took the phone back, added his own signature without reading any more than Brad had, and hit submit. &quot;Ecstatic. Now we have rules. Structure. A framework for cohabitation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have a binding agreement neither of us read.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to adulthood.&quot;</p>
<p>The contract activated with no fanfare. No notification. No acknowledgment. Just a subtle shift in the air, like the house had been holding its breath and finally exhaled.</p>
<p>Or maybe that was just the foundation settling. Hard to tell with a house this old.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The brothers actually made it a week without getting into an argument. Mostly by avoiding each other completely. Different meal times. Different bathroom schedules. Careful choreography to minimize contact. It almost worked.</p>
<p>Then Louise Walsh showed up.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang at 6:47pm. Brad and Alex both looked up from their respective corners of the common room-Brad on the couch with his laptop open to his blog (current post: &quot;Why Three&#39;s Company Secretly Explained Late-Stage Capitalism,&quot; current readers: zero), Alex at the dining room table with storyboards for tomorrow&#39;s pitch meeting spread out.</p>
<p>They looked at the door. Then at each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You get it,&quot; Alex said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s your house too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m busy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m also busy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re blogging. That&#39;s not busy. That&#39;s procrastination with a URL.&quot;</p>
<p>Before Brad could respond with something cutting about advertising being propaganda for capitalism, the door opened.</p>
<p>Louise Walsh didn&#39;t wait for invitations. She never had, not in the thirty years she&#39;d lived next door and appointed herself the neighborhood&#39;s unofficial mayor, conscience, and gossip clearinghouse. She walked in carrying a casserole dish covered in aluminum foil, her short gray hair perfectly curled.</p>
<p>At sixty-something, she had the energy of someone half her age and the opinions of someone who&#39;d seen everything twice and had thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;Boys!&quot; She set the casserole on the coffee table without asking, right on top of the TV Guide from 1987 that their father had kept for reasons known only to him and possibly God. &quot;I saw the cars and knew you&#39;d moved in! I&#39;ve been dying to come over but I didn&#39;t want to intrude too soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad and Alex stared in silence, neither quite sure how to respond to this cheerful invasion.</p>
<p>Louise surveyed the room with the keen eye of someone conducting a home inspection. &quot;Now, I know you boys are probably eating terribly-bachelors always do-so I made you my famous tuna casserole.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad looked at the casserole with barely concealed horror. He could see chunks of something gray suspended in beige sauce, topped with potato chips that had gone soggy from condensation. It looked like something that had died and then been reanimated through dark magic.</p>
<p>&quot;Brad, honey-how&#39;s the writing going? Are you working on anything?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad felt his face flush. &quot;I&#39;m working on my blog. It&#39;s about-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t work,&quot; Alex cut in, the words coming out sharper than he probably intended. A week of careful silence had left him with no filter. &quot;He just sits on the couch all day watching TV. He doesn&#39;t even exercise. Just sits there.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s jaw tightened. &quot;At least I&#39;m not-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you, Alex,&quot; Louise pivoted, &quot;you look so stressed. All those lines in your face. Are you taking care of yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He works himself to death,&quot; Brad said, the resentment pouring out in retaliation. &quot;He&#39;s always working. Never relaxes. Never stops. It&#39;s like he&#39;s trying to have a heart attack by forty-six.&quot;</p>

<p>They glared at each other across Louise&#39;s perfectly curled head. She looked between them, smiled pleasantly, and headed for the door.</p>
<p>&quot;You boys take care now. I&#39;ll check in again soon.&quot;</p>
<p>She left before either of them could respond, pulling the door shut behind her with a decisive click that somehow sounded like judgment. Alex picked up the casserole dish like it might explode and headed toward the kitchen, already trying to figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p>Brad stared at the closed door for a long moment. &quot;Classic Nosy Neighbor trope. She&#39;s going to insert herself into our lives at regular intervals and offer unsolicited advice that somehow always turns out to be plot-relevant. Mrs. Kravitz from Bewitched. Wilson from Home Improvement. Kimmy Gibbler from Full House.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s just a person, Brad!&quot; Alex shouted from the kitchen.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Brad&#39;s eyes opened at six the next morning.</p>
<p>This was wrong on multiple levels. Brad didn&#39;t wake up at 6:00am. Brad didn&#39;t wake up before noon if he could help it. His entire lifestyle for the past three years had been built around the principle that morning people were suspiciously cheerful and probably up to something.</p>
<p>But his eyes opened at 6:00am and his body felt restless. Like it wanted to do something. Like it expected him to move.</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#39;t even exercise. Just sits there.&quot; Alex&#39;s voice from the night before echoed in his head.</p>
<p>Brad lay in bed staring at the ceiling, thinking about his routine. Wake up late. Check his blog stats (depressing). Watch Cheers. Eat something. Watch The Odd Couple. Work a bit more. Watch Three&#39;s Company. Go to bed. Repeat.</p>
<p>He&#39;d been doing it for three years. Since Hannah died. Since the Tribune laid him off. Since the world stopped making sense and the only thing that felt manageable was the couch and the TV and the same jokes he&#39;d heard a thousand times.</p>
<p>Brad got up. This felt wrong, like he was betraying some fundamental principle. He dug through his unpacked boxes until he found a pair old sneakers. They felt weird. He couldn&#39;t remember the last time he&#39;d worn actual shoes.</p>
<p>He went outside.</p>
<p>The morning air was cool and aggressively cheerful. Birds were singing like they had something to prove. The sun was doing that thing where it painted the sky in pastels, which felt unnecessary and show-offy. Brad started walking. Not running-he wasn&#39;t that ambitious yet-but a brisk walk around the block.</p>
<p>His legs protested. His lungs burned. His body filed several formal complaints about this sudden and unwelcome development in their relationship.</p>
<p>But by the time he got back to the house twenty minutes later, sweating and out of breath and slightly dizzy, he felt something he hadn&#39;t felt in three years.</p>
<p>Awake.</p>
<p>He stood in the driveway, hands on his knees, breathing hard. That wasn&#39;t so bad, he thought. Maybe I could do that again tomorrow. Maybe this is just me making a healthy choice. Maybe Alex is right and I have been sitting around too much.</p>
<p>That afternoon, he googled &quot;gyms near me&quot; and found a 24-hour fitness place three blocks away. Month-to-month membership, no contract, lots of machines he didn&#39;t know how to use. He signed up online, telling himself he probably wouldn&#39;t go more than once or twice, but at least it was something.</p>
<p>At least it was progress.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>That same morning, Alex&#39;s alarm went off at 6:00am like it had every day for twenty years. He stared at it, finger hovering over the screen.</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s complaint echoed in his mind. &quot;He&#39;s always working. Never relaxes.&quot;</p>
<p>The Anderson campaign was behind schedule. The client was getting impatient. His boss had sent three emails yesterday marked URGENT in the subject line, which was his boss&#39;s way of saying &quot;I&#39;m panicking and now you get to panic too.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex should get up. Should shower. Should get to the office early to catch up.</p>
<p>He turned off the alarm and went back to sleep.</p>
<p>When he finally woke at 9:30am, he felt disoriented, like he&#39;d overslept for an important meeting. But also... relaxed. Rested. He picked up his phone to check his work email-four new messages from his boss, two from the client, one from his assistant asking if he was okay-and found himself responding that he was taking a sick day.</p>
<p>&quot;It can wait.&quot;</p>
<p>The thought felt foreign, like someone else had put it in his head. Alex didn&#39;t let things wait. Alex was the guy who answered emails at midnight. Who worked weekends. Who took his laptop on vacation except he never went on vacation because someone had to keep things running.</p>
<p>But today, he stayed home. Made coffee. Sat on the ugly orange couch his parents had owned since Nixon was president and read a book he&#39;d been meaning to read for five years. When his phone rang with calls from work, he declined them. When emails came through marked URGENT, he skimmed them and decided they weren&#39;t actually urgent at all. Everything was urgent to his boss. Very little was actually urgent to reality.</p>
<p>By evening, he felt lighter. Less tense. Like someone had loosened a knot in his chest that he&#39;d been carrying so long he&#39;d forgotten it was there.</p>
<p>Maybe Brad had been right. Maybe he had been working too hard. Maybe this was just him making healthy choices. Maybe he was finally learning to relax.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Two days later, Alex opened the refrigerator looking for something to eat for breakfast and was immediately assaulted by a smell that suggested something had died, decomposed, and then continued its journey into states of matter that science hadn&#39;t yet named.</p>
<p>Five takeout containers sat on the top shelf in various states of decay. Some had been there since before their parents died. All were Brad&#39;s. Alex recognized the containers from the Chinese place two blocks over that Brad kept ordering from despite the fact that their Yelp reviews included phrases like &quot;mild food poisoning&quot; and &quot;probably a front for something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus Christ, Brad!&quot; Alex yelled toward the bedroom. &quot;There&#39;s rotting takeout containers everywhere. It&#39;s disgusting what you eat. This is fucking nasty!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad appeared in the kitchen doorway looking annoyed at being interrupted. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This!&quot; Alex gestured at the open refrigerator like it was evidence of a crime. &quot;How long has this shit been in here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. A few days?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try a few weeks. It&#39;s growing things. Things with fuzzy colors. I think one of them is developing sentience.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s expression hardened. &quot;Whatever! You need to stop being so uptight and controlling.&quot;</p>
<p>They glared at each other. Alex grabbed his wallet and his phone. &quot;I&#39;m going to work. Don&#39;t touch my stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>He left, slamming the door hard enough to make the macram&eacute; owl swing on its hook.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The next morning, Brad woke up early-his new routine apparently sticking despite his better judgment-and went for his walk. When he came back, sweaty and strangely energized, he opened the refrigerator to get water and saw the takeout containers still sitting there.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s disgusting what you eat.&quot; Alex&#39;s words echoed in his head.</p>
<p>As he stared at the containers, he realized Alex had been right. Brad had a collection of garbage scattered around the house. Takeout containers on the coffee table from restaurants he couldn&#39;t remember ordering from. Pizza boxes stacked near the TV like a cardboard tower of shame. Empty protein bar wrappers stuffed between couch cushions where they&#39;d formed a small civilization.</p>
<p>Brad spent the next hour cleaning. He cleaned out the refrigerator. Wiped down the counters. Threw away the mystery containers from the back of the pantry that predated their parents&#39; death.</p>
<p>Then he went to the grocery store.</p>
<p>Brad grabbed things at random: chicken breasts, brown rice, bags of frozen vegetables that looked nutritious and vaguely punishing. Protein powder because the guy at the gym had mentioned it. A collection of supplements that promised various improvements to his life.</p>
<p>That evening, he spent two hours on YouTube learning how to meal prep. By the next afternoon, he had five days of portioned meals in tupperware containers, all lined up in the refrigerator in neat rows. Chicken and rice and broccoli. The same meal five times. It looked boring. It looked healthy. It looked like something a functional adult would do.</p>
<p>When Alex got home from work, he opened the fridge and stared.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you... cook?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. So what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. It&#39;s just... when did you learn to cook?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;YouTube. Turns out there are tutorials for everything, including how to function like an adult.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked at the tupperware containers, all labeled with days of the week in Brad&#39;s handwriting. Then he noticed the disaster in the kitchen-every pot and pan they owned piled in the sink, chicken juice on the counter, rice scattered across the stove.</p>
<p>He felt his jaw tighten. He opened his mouth to say something about cleaning up after yourself, about how meal prep was great but maybe try not to destroy the kitchen in the process-</p>
<p>Brad&#39;s voice from earlier echoed in his head. &quot;You need to stop being so uptight and controlling.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex closed his mouth. Took a breath. &quot;Looks good,&quot; he said instead, and walked to his room.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>A week later, Alex arrived home with his arms full of shopping bags. He&#39;d found himself compelled to put $500 he definitely didn&#39;t have on his credit card after Brad had commented on him always wearing &quot;the same wrinkled suits to work like a funeral director who&#39;s really bad at his job.&quot; He now had three new dress shirts in colors that weren&#39;t gray, two pairs of slacks that actually fit, a burgundy sweater the salesperson had insisted on, and even a leather jacket he&#39;d probably never have the courage to wear.</p>
<p>He found Brad on the couch wearing blue basketball shorts and a sweatshirt in some kind of neon green that seemed designed to be visible from space-the result of Brad&#39;s own shopping trip after Alex had retorted that morning that Brad had only worn black and grey since Hannah died.</p>
<p>For once, Alex couldn&#39;t detect Brad&#39;s usual post-gym aroma. Over the last few days, Brad had developed a proper hygiene routine. Actual showers with soap. Deodorant. Cologne. The basics, really, but consistently. All because Alex had commented, post-run, that Brad &quot;smelled like a gym locker.&quot;</p>
<p>In retaliation, Brad had told Alex his hair looked like he&#39;d &quot;cut it himself with safety scissors while drunk&quot;-mostly accurate, except for the drunk part. This led to Alex scheduling an appointment with a stylist named Ramona who&#39;d spent two hours transforming his self-inflicted disaster into something that made him look, according to Derek, &quot;like an actual human person.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You look good,&quot; Brad said, eyeing the bags. &quot;New clothes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. You too. The color thing is... working.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>They blinked at each other for a long moment, not sure how to end a conversation that didn&#39;t involve petty insults. Alex finally turned and headed to his room to put away his purchases.</p>
<p>Brad watched him go, then turned to face a camera that wasn&#39;t there. &quot;And so the Tate brothers discover that living together might not be so bad after all. They&#39;re helping each other. Growing. Becoming better men. Will this trend continue? Or will their old habits return? Find out next time, on The Tates.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p><strong>EPISODE 2: &quot;NAILED IT!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Welcome back to The Tate Brothers! A lot can happen in a week. Alex and Brad have settled into what you might call a routine. They&#39;re polite. They&#39;re civil. They even have conversations that don&#39;t end in someone storming off. By Tate standards, this is basically a miracle. They&#39;re helping each other. Growing. Becoming better-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brad!&quot; Alex&#39;s voice echoed from the bathroom, sharp and irritated. &quot;Get in here!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad found Alex standing at the sink, toothbrush in one hand, pointing at the counter with the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at this,&quot; Alex said through toothpaste foam. &quot;Just look at it.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad looked. Beard trimmings scattered across the white porcelain like evidence of a crime he&#39;d committed and forgotten about.</p>
<p>This was the fifth day in a row. Maybe sixth. Brad had gotten obsessive about his grooming routine-which was good, better than the unwashed disaster he&#39;d been before-but apparently cleaning up after himself hadn&#39;t been part of the upgrade package. Alex had been fine letting things go, but his new relaxed attitude only went so far.</p>
<p>&quot;You have GOT to stop leaving beard trimmings all over the bathroom sink every single day!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So clean them up if it bothers you!&quot; Brad&#39;s voice came from his bedroom, muffled and unapologetic.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s YOUR mess!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s not that bad. Want to know what is bad? The shower drain is clogged with your body hair again. Have you ever heard of manscaping?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell is manscaping?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly my point. You&#39;re like a Wookiee. A Wookiee who doesn&#39;t understand basic grooming.&quot;</p>
<p>They glared at each other. Alex spat toothpaste into the sink-right on top of the beard trimmings-and Brad retreated to finish getting ready for his second workout of the day. Both of them fuming over the other&#39;s failures.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The next morning, Brad went through his grooming routine-the routine that had become almost ritualistic in its precision. Shower, shampoo, condition, rinse, body wash, face wash, rinse, dry, moisturize, deodorant, cologne. He examined his face in the mirror and picked up his electric trimmer.</p>
<p>But as he looked at his reflection, he made a decision. He&#39;d had the beard for so long. Why not shave it all off. Go smooth. Alex wouldn&#39;t complain about beard trimmings anymore.</p>
<p>He switched to a razor and carefully removed every trace of facial hair, working in neat strokes. When he finished and splashed cold water on his face, his skin felt smooth and perfect.</p>
<p>He ran his hand along his jaw, checking for spots he&#39;d missed. Nothing. Perfectly smooth.</p>
<p>What Brad didn&#39;t notice-what he couldn&#39;t notice, because how could you notice something not happening-was that his facial hair had stopped growing. Completely. Permanently. The follicles had simply shut down, decided they were no longer needed, and gone dormant like some kind of biological retirement.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>That evening, Alex stood in the shower thinking about his terrible day. The Anderson campaign was a disaster. The client wanted changes that made no sense. His boss was panicking. His coworker Derek had spent an hour trying to convince him that cryptocurrency mining using vintage computers was &quot;the future&quot; despite all evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>He went through his routine-expensive shampoo, the kind Ramona had recommended. His new haircut was holding up. His new clothes fit properly. He&#39;d even started getting compliments from coworkers again. It felt great.</p>
<p>After toweling off, Alex stood naked at the mirror and looked at himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Manscaping?&quot; he muttered. &quot;Whatever Brad, I don&#39;t need manscaping.&quot;</p>
<p>And he was right. He looked at his chest, his arms, his legs-smooth. Completely hairless below his eyebrows. Nothing to manscape at all.</p>
<p>He didn&#39;t question it. Didn&#39;t wonder when it had happened or why. It just... was. He looked fine. Better than fine, actually. Clean. Streamlined.</p>
<p>Alex got dressed and went to bed, already thinking about tomorrow&#39;s client meeting, not giving his hairless body a second thought.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The doorbell rang at 6:47pm, right in the middle of Brad&#39;s latest blog post about whether Three&#39;s Company was secretly about the housing crisis.</p>
<p>Brad got up from the couch and opened the door. He was wearing fitted compression shorts in electric blue and a tank top that actually showed he&#39;d been working out-the new athletic wear he&#39;d been living in ever since Alex had complained that his baggy gym clothes were &quot;threatening to fall off your skinny ass and nobody wants to see that wardrobe malfunction.&quot; Brad had found himself ordering them online later that day without really thinking about it, and now they were all he wanted to wear.</p>
<p>Alex&#39;s coworker Derek stood at the door with his laptop bag and an expression that suggested he&#39;d either discovered the meaning of life or was about to pitch an investment opportunity that would definitely not end well.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, is Alex home?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad grinned. &quot;Ah, the Wacky Coworker arrives. Right on schedule. Let me guess-some kind of scheme. Technology-based. Questionable legality. Definitely involving something that had its moment in the nineties.&quot;</p>
<p>Derek tried to look offended but his face was too honest. &quot;Well, actually, I&#39;ve been looking into authentication systems for collectibles using distributed ledgers-specifically vintage Beanie Babies as a proof of concept-&quot;</p>
<p>Brad rolled his eyes. &quot;There it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, seriously, hear me out-&quot; Derek started his pitch right on the doorstep, hands gesturing wildly.</p>
<p>Brad waved him off. &quot;Alex just got out of the shower. Have fun with your Beanie Baby Blockchain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s not-actually, that&#39;s genius branding.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad walked back toward his bedroom. As soon as his door closed, he turned up his music. Loud. The kind of aggressive death metal he&#39;d been listening to since college-blast beats and guttural vocals and guitar riffs that sounded like murder.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>In the living room, Derek winced at the sudden wall of sound. Alex emerged from the hallway in a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head like a turban.</p>
<p>But what Derek noticed first was how Alex moved. He glided across the living room and settled onto the couch with fluidity, adjusting his towel-turban without a single awkward movement. It was strange. Derek couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on why, but Alex seemed different.</p>
<p>Alex was different. Three days ago, he had rushed through this same room, catastrophically late for a meeting with the Anderson account. Briefcase in one hand, coffee in the other, and mind already at the office, running through the presentation he&#39;d stayed up until 2am perfecting. In his rush, he&#39;d crashed shin-first into the coffee table. With a one-in-a-million shot that happened only on TV, Alex&#39;s coffee had arced through the air and doused Brad&#39;s laptop. Brad had screamed about Alex being clumsy, always knocking into things. Alex had fired back about Brad&#39;s baggy gym clothes threatening a wardrobe malfunction.</p>
<p>Now, Alex moved like a dancer. And Brad was dressed in compression wear that left nothing to the imagination.</p>
<p>&quot;Derek,&quot; Alex said. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to pitch you on something.&quot; Derek set his laptop on the coffee table and started pulling up spreadsheets. &quot;Okay, so authentication and provenance in the collectibles market-&quot;</p>
<p>He stopped mid-sentence as the music from Brad&#39;s room suddenly increased in volume. The bass thrummed through the walls. The vocals sounded like someone torturing a demon who deserved it.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you live with that?&quot; Derek asked, raising his voice.</p>
<p>Alex settled deeper into the couch. &quot;What? Can&#39;t hear you over Brad&#39;s music!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you LIVE with that? Seriously, how are you not insane?&quot;</p>
<p>Derek had a point. The music was oppressive, a wall of sound that made concentration impossible. Alex had been tolerating it for weeks now, telling himself it was fine, Brad could listen to whatever he wanted, they were both adults who respected each other&#39;s space.</p>
<p>But suddenly-with Derek here, asking the obvious question, forcing Alex to actually acknowledge how completely insane this was-he couldn&#39;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>&quot;Your awful death metal is the worst!&quot; Alex yelled as he stormed toward Brad&#39;s room, loud enough to be heard over the auditory assault. &quot;Turn it down!&quot;</p>
<p>The music decreased by approximately half a decibel. Brad&#39;s voice came from behind his door: &quot;I was about to take a shower anyway!&quot;</p>
<p>A moment later, Brad&#39;s door opened and he headed for the bathroom, shooting Alex a look that clearly communicated you&#39;re ruining my creative process as he passed.</p>
<p>Brad turned on the shower and immediately swore loud enough for both Alex and Derek to hear down the hallway.</p>
<p>&quot;Dammit, Alex!&quot; Brad&#39;s voice echoed from the bathroom. &quot;You used up all the hot water! Stop taking such long showers!&quot;</p>
<p>In the living room, Derek pretended not to sense the tension and launched into his full Beanie Baby pitch. Something about why this was definitely going to work despite the fact that his last three schemes had ended with the phrase &quot;well, at least I learned something.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex tried to listen. He really did. But he kept thinking about Brad&#39;s complaint. &quot;Stop taking such long showers.&quot; Like it was Alex&#39;s fault the hot water heater in this house was from 1983 and had the capacity of a teacup.</p>
<p>Derek was still talking. Alex nodded along, not really listening, thinking about hot water and shower schedules and why everything in this house felt like a fight waiting to happen.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The next morning, Brad woke at 6am sharp, his body clock now more reliable than any alarm. He got up, put on his running shoes, and grabbed his phone to queue up his running playlist.</p>
<p>He scrolled to his usual options-the death metal, the hardcore, the aggressive stuff that made his legs want to move.</p>
<p>But his finger kept scrolling. Past his saved playlists. Past his recently played. Past everything he&#39;d been listening to for twenty years.</p>
<p>His finger stopped on something called &quot;Today&#39;s Top Pop Hits.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn&#39;t remember adding this. He didn&#39;t listen to pop music. Pop music was for shopping malls and teenagers and people who didn&#39;t understand that music was supposed to mean something.</p>
<p>But his thumb hovered over it. And then, without quite deciding to, he clicked it.</p>
<p>Upbeat, bubbly pop music started playing through his earbuds. A woman&#39;s voice sang about love and summer over synthesizers and programmed drums. The kind of music Hannah used to listen to while cooking, that he&#39;d made fun of until she threw a dish towel at his head.</p>
<p>Brad froze.</p>
<p>He&#39;d hated this music yesterday. He&#39;d hated it his entire adult life. He&#39;d actively avoided stores that played it.</p>
<p>But now it sounded... good?</p>
<p>He tried to change it back. Opened his death metal playlist-hundreds of songs, thousands of hours. Clicked play.</p>
<p>The blast beats and screaming sounded wrong. Harsh. Grating. Like someone scraping metal against his eardrums on purpose. He grimaced and switched back to the pop music.</p>
<p>The cheerful melody resumed. It sounded perfect.</p>
<p>Brad stared at his phone. &quot;What the fuck.&quot;</p>
<p>He went for his run anyway. The pop music played the whole time. He felt like the beats were carrying him along on his run. By the time he got home, he&#39;d given up trying to fight it.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>Brad arrived home sweating and confused, heading straight for the bathroom to shower. The door was locked.</p>
<p>&quot;Alex? You in there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just-give me a few minutes!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad checked his watch. He needed to get cleaned up. He smelled. &quot;How long have you been in there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know, like... half an hour?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad pressed his ear to the door. He could hear water splashing. Not the shower. And was that music? Soft music? And did he smell lavender?</p>
<p>&quot;Are you taking a bath?&quot;</p>
<p>A pause. &quot;So what if I am?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad blinked. Alex didn&#39;t take baths. Like any self-respecting adult man, Alex took showers.</p>
<p>&quot;Just... how much longer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know. A while.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad went to the half-bath near the kitchen, splashed some water on his face, and tried not to think about how his brother was apparently spending his mornings in bubble baths while Brad&#39;s brain was being hijacked by Taylor Swift.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>An hour later, the bathroom door opened and Alex emerged in a cloud of lavender-scented steam that made the living room smell like a spa. He was wearing that nice bathrobe and had the dazed, peaceful expression of someone who&#39;d just spent two hours doing absolutely nothing productive.</p>
<p>Alex looked confused but happy. Like he couldn&#39;t quite figure out why he&#39;d spent so much time in a bubble bath with scented candles and essential oils, but also didn&#39;t regret it.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m listening to pop music,&quot; Brad said without preamble.</p>
<p>Alex blinked at him. &quot;Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hate pop music. I&#39;ve always hated pop music. I&#39;ve made fun of people who listen to pop music. I wrote a blog post about how pop music represents the death of meaningful art.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So turn it off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; Brad held up his phone like it was evidence in a trial. &quot;Everything else sounds wrong. Literally painful to listen to. My brain won&#39;t let me change it back.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex gracefully sat down on the other end of the couch, still damp and smelling like a Bath & Body Works had exploded. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And since when do you take bubble baths? With lavender? For two hours?&quot;</p>
<p>They looked at each other across the couch.</p>
<p>Brad felt something click in his mind-a pattern he&#39;d been seeing but refusing to acknowledge. But the pop music had pushed him over some kind of edge. This wasn&#39;t normal. This wasn&#39;t two roommates gradually influencing each other. This wasn&#39;t them &quot;getting along better.&quot;</p>
<p>This was something else.</p>
<p>&quot;This is like... okay, in sitcoms, there&#39;s always an episode where weird things happen because of some magical object. A lamp, a painting, a mysterious ghost. And the characters don&#39;t realize it at first because the changes are gradual, but then-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brad, real life doesn&#39;t work like sitcoms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But look at us! Every time we complain about each other, we change! Don&#39;t you see the pattern?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s not how reality works. That&#39;s not how anything works.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then explain the pop music!&quot; Brad stood up, started pacing, his journalist brain finally kicking in after weeks of dormancy. &quot;Explain your bath! Explain why I&#39;m going to the gym twice a day when three weeks ago I couldn&#39;t walk to the mailbox without getting winded! Explain why you&#39;re taking days off work when you used to answer emails at 2am!&quot;</p>
<p>Alex opened his mouth, then closed it. He sat there in his expensive bathrobe he didn&#39;t remember buying, smelling like lavender, unable to explain why he&#39;d just spent two hours in a bubble bath.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we&#39;re just... listening to each other for once,&quot; Alex said, but his voice lacked conviction. &quot;Maybe we&#39;re being good roommates. Good brothers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since when are we good brothers? We bicker. We compete. We&#39;ve been doing it since we were kids. And we don&#39;t suddenly both become completely different people because we&#39;re being nicer to each other. That&#39;s not how this works.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad kept pacing, his hands moving as he talked, falling into the pattern he used to use when he was working on a story. &quot;Think about it. Really think. You said I sit around all day-I started going to the gym. I said you work too much-you took a personal day. You said my gym clothes were falling off-I bought fitted ones. I said your hair looked like shit-you got a professional haircut. Back and forth. Every single time. Every complaint leads to a change.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s coincidence. Correlation, not causation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You take bubble baths now, Alex. BUBBLE BATHS. You skip work. You&#39;re a completely different person than you were three weeks ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#39;m an athlete now?&quot; Brad continued, his voice rising. &quot;I wear color-coordinated athleisure. I&#39;m obsessed with protein powder and macros and whatever the hell a &#39;clean bulk&#39; is. I&#39;m not the same person either!&quot;</p>
<p>They stared at each other across the living room. The pop music continued playing from Brad&#39;s phone. Something upbeat about summer and beaches and falling in love and everything being perfect forever.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The next morning, Brad sat at the kitchen table eating his precisely portioned breakfast: egg whites, turkey sausage, a protein shake mixed to exact specifications, a multivitamin.</p>
<p>He watched Alex make coffee, moving with that unconscious grace, navigating the kitchen like every movement was choreographed.</p>
<p>Alex raised his hand to his mouth and bit his thumbnail, gnawing at it absently while staring at the coffee maker. It was a habit he&#39;d had since childhood. One their mother had tried unsuccessfully to break with rewards and punishments and gentle reminders that turned into yelling. His nails were always ragged, bitten down to the quick, sometimes bloody when he was stressed.</p>
<p>Brad had always hated it. Even as a kid, watching Alex destroy his nails had made his skin crawl.</p>
<p>But now, watching Alex chew his thumbnail while waiting for coffee that was taking too long to brew, Brad saw something else.</p>
<p>An opportunity. A test.</p>
<p>If his theory was right-if complaints actually caused changes in some impossible, inexplicable way-then he could prove it. Pick something specific, something measurable, something that couldn&#39;t be explained away as coincidence or self-improvement or personal growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Biting your nails is disgusting,&quot; Brad said. His voice was calm. Deliberate. Each word carefully chosen like he was writing a headline. &quot;You have to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex pulled his hand away from his mouth. &quot;Whatever.&quot; Alex grabbed his coffee, suddenly defensive, suddenly annoyed in a way that felt disproportionate. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s disgusting. You&#39;re forty-two years old. Act like it.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex&#39;s jaw tightened. &quot;Fuck off, Brad.&quot;</p>
<p>He took his coffee and headed to his room. The door closed with more force than necessary, rattling the macram&eacute; owl on the wall.</p>
<p>Brad sat at the table, his breakfast forgotten, waiting.</p>
<p>If he was right, something would happen.</p>
<p>If he was wrong, he was losing his mind.</p>
<p>Either way, he&#39;d have an answer.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>An hour later, Brad returned from his morning run-his new running shoes, his new route, his new life that still felt like someone else&#39;s. He was making his post-workout smoothie when Alex walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>He was staring at his hands.</p>
<p>Brad turned around and felt his stomach drop.</p>
<p>Alex&#39;s fingernails were long. Not just long-perfectly shaped, professionally filed smooth, extending a quarter-inch past his fingertips. They looked manicured. They looked expensive. They looked like someone had spent an hour in a salon getting them exactly right.</p>
<p>And they were polished. Pink polish. Glossy and perfect, catching the kitchen light.</p>

<p>&quot;Brad!&quot; Alex&#39;s voice was high with panic. He held up his hands, fingers spread wide, like he was showing evidence at a crime scene. &quot;What the fuck is this?&quot;</p>
<p>Brad felt vindication and horror in equal measure. It had worked. The test had worked. His insane theory about magical complaints was correct.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you do?&quot; Alex demanded, his voice rising. &quot;What the fuck did you do to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I complained about your nail-biting,&quot; Brad said quietly. &quot;I did it on purpose. To test if-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You did this to me?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not me. The magic. Whatever the hell this is. Don&#39;t you see? Every complaint changes us.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex tried to bring his hand to his mouth-the old habit, the automatic response to stress, the thing he&#39;d been doing since he was six years old. His hand moved halfway to his face, then stopped. Like it had hit an invisible wall. His muscles strained. His arm trembled with effort. But his hand wouldn&#39;t reach his mouth. His body simply wouldn&#39;t let him bite his nails anymore.</p>
<p>He tried again. Same result. The barrier held.</p>
<p>&quot;This is insane,&quot; Alex whispered, staring at his pink-polished nails. &quot;This is completely fucking insane. There&#39;s no such thing as magic. This doesn&#39;t happen. This can&#39;t happen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it did.&quot; Brad gestured at Alex&#39;s hands. &quot;Look at you. Look at us. This is real.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex sank into a chair, still staring at his hands. He flexed his fingers, watching the pink nails catch the light.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we do?&quot; Alex asked quietly, and for the first time since moving in-maybe for the first time since they were kids-he sounded genuinely scared.</p>
<p>Brad sank into a chair across from him, his journalist brain trying to work through the problem. &quot;When did this start? The first change?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After Louise came over. I said something about you being a slob. You started exercising the next day.&quot;</p>
<p>They both looked at each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Louise a witch?&quot; Alex asked.</p>
<p>&quot;What? No. She&#39;s just-&quot; Brad stopped. &quot;Wait. When did we sign that roommate agreement?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The day we moved in. Before all this happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad stood up. &quot;We need to read it. Actually read it this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex got out his phone and opened the PDF. The same document they&#39;d both signed without reading, scrolled through in thirty seconds, dismissed as boring legal garbage that didn&#39;t matter.</p>
<p>Now they read every word.</p>
<p>Page 1: Standard terms and conditions. Nothing unusual.</p>
<p>Page 5: Dispute resolution procedures. Mediation clauses. Arbitration options. All normal.</p>
<p>Page 12: Section 12-C. Buried in subsection D, paragraph 4, between clauses about noise complaints and trash disposal:</p>
<p>&quot;Upon any remediation request between cohabitating parties, the parties agree to undergo sufficient corrective measures to optimize compatibility and interpersonal harmony through such modifications as necessary to achieve satisfactory cohabitation outcomes. Each party is allotted thirty (30) remediation requests. Upon completion of all allotted requests without achieving compatibility, the parties shall be considered in default and this Agreement shall terminate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remediation request,&quot; Brad said. &quot;That&#39;s a fancy way of saying complaints.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty complaints each.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ve used eight already.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence. The macram&eacute; owl watched from the wall, judging them with its knotted eyes.</p>
<p>Sixteen complaints total. Sixteen changes. And they had twenty-two more each before-before what? The Agreement terminated? What did that mean? What happened when they hit thirty?</p>
<p>&quot;At least it stops after thirty complaints,&quot; Alex said weakly, grasping at any positive interpretation.</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Brad&#39;s voice was firm. &quot;We need to stop now. Before it gets worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much worse could it get? We&#39;re just... more polite versions of ourselves. Better groomed. Healthier. Is that really so bad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have pink nails, Alex. I listen to pop music I physically can&#39;t stop listening to. We&#39;re not &#39;better versions&#39; of ourselves. We&#39;re being changed into something else.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex looked at his hands. At the pink polish that looked so natural he kept forgetting it was there. &quot;We just don&#39;t complain anymore. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the solution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think we can live together for however long this takes and not complain about anything?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have to try.&quot;</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>The truce was immediate, absolute, and doomed from the start.</p>
<p>No more complaining. No criticism, no fights, no comments about each other-nothing that could possibly be interpreted as a remediation request by whatever magical contract bullshit was running their lives now. They would avoid each other completely if necessary. They would communicate only when absolutely required, using the minimum number of words possible.</p>
<p>They would stop feeding the Agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t talk unless it&#39;s necessary,&quot; Brad said. &quot;And even then, we keep it neutral. No observations about each other. No opinions. Nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Agreed.&quot;</p>
<p>They shook hands. Alex&#39;s grip was softer now, his long pink nails scratching slightly against Brad&#39;s palm.</p>
<p>Then they retreated to their separate rooms.</p>
<p>Brad lay on his bed, listening to pop music he didn&#39;t want to like but couldn&#39;t turn off. Alex sat at his desk trying to work, trying not to look at his manicured hands every thirty seconds, trying not to think about what would happen if they failed.</p>
<p>Hours passed. Neither complained. Neither spoke except to say &quot;excuse me&quot; when they passed in the hallway, or &quot;your turn&quot; when they needed the bathroom.</p>
<p>They made it through dinner without incident. Brad ate his meal-prepped chicken and rice in his room while watching Cheers with the volume low. Alex ordered Thai food and ate at his desk while working on the Anderson campaign that was somehow still not finished.</p>
<p>By 10pm, they&#39;d made it fourteen hours without a single complaint.</p>
<p>It felt like victory. Like maybe they could actually do this. Like maybe they&#39;d outsmarted whatever malevolent force was rewriting their lives one complaint at a time.</p>
<p>They were wrong, of course.</p>
<p>But for fourteen hours, they had hope.</p>
        <div class="scene-break">✦ ✦ ✦</div>
<p>At 11:47pm, Alex was on the phone with Derek, talking about Derek&#39;s latest idea-something about converting old arcade cabinets into premium coffee tables with working screens and selling them to nostalgic tech bros.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m just saying,&quot; Derek was explaining, &quot;if we source copies of the original ROMs from China-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s legal, Derek.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everything&#39;s legal if you phrase it correctly in the terms of service.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s definitely not true.&quot;</p>
<p>Alex&#39;s voice carried through the walls the way it always had. Deep and resonant and impossible to escape in a house with thin walls and poor insulation. Every word vibrated through the structure like the house was amplifying it on purpose.</p>
<p>In the next room, Brad lay in bed trying to sleep. He&#39;d been trying for over an hour. He had earplugs in, a pillow pressed over his head, but he could still hear every word. Every syllable traveled through the walls like they were made of paper and spite.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good investment, Derek.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad tried to focus on breathing. Tried counting backward from one hundred.</p>
<p>&quot;But the legal hurdles-&quot;</p>
<p>His jaw clenched. His hands balled into fists.</p>
<p>&quot;Still no.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad pulled the pillow tighter over his head, his defenses worn down after fourteen hours of careful silence, his filter completely gone at midnight after a day of hypervigilance.</p>
<p>He muttered to himself, frustrated and half-asleep: &quot;His voice is so deep it vibrates through the damn walls.&quot;</p>
<p>Quiet. Barely above a whisper. Said to himself, no one else.</p>
<p>It was a complaint. But surely it didn&#39;t count.</p>
<p>He could still hear Alex&#39;s voice from the next room. Suddenly, a pause.</p>
<p>Fifteen seconds of silence.</p>
<p>Then a scream pierced through the house: &quot;BRAAAADDDD!!!!&quot;</p>
<p>It was high-pitched and piercing, not a man&#39;s roar of anger but a girl&#39;s shriek of terror. The sound filled the house, echoed off the walls, made the macram&eacute; owl tremble on its hook.</p>
<p>Brad bolted upright in bed, his heart pounding. He ran to Alex&#39;s room and threw open the door without knocking.</p>
<p>Alex was standing in the middle of the room, phone on the floor where he&#39;d dropped it, both hands clutching his throat like he was trying to strangle himself.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>Alex tried to speak, but what came out was a high, feminine voice: &quot;What did you do? Did you complain about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to, I just thought-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You broke the truce!&quot; Alex&#39;s new voice rose in pitch with his panic, making him sound like a terrified teenager, making every word come out breathy and wrong. &quot;You broke it! You SAID we weren&#39;t going to complain anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t thinking, I was half-asleep, I-&quot;</p>
<p>But Alex wasn&#39;t listening. He was furious. Panicking. And falling back into their lifelong pattern-the rivalry, the tit-for-tat, the one-upsmanship that had defined their relationship for forty years, that had survived two divorces and one death and moving into their dead parents&#39; house.</p>
<p>If Brad was going to hurt him, even accidentally, then Alex was going to hurt him back.</p>
<p>It was automatic. Instinctive. Inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Alex said, his feminine voice sharp with anger. &quot;If that&#39;s how you want it, this means war!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, wait, stop, think about what you&#39;re-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your voice.&quot; Alex spoke each word deliberately, looking Brad straight in the eye, making absolutely sure he understood what was happening, what was about to happen, what couldn&#39;t be taken back. &quot;Is. So. Annoying!&quot;</p>
<p>Brad felt his throat tighten. The change was immediate and violent-his vocal cords shifting, rearranging, tightening like guitar strings being tuned up several octaves all at once. It felt like someone was pulling strings inside his throat, making everything higher and lighter and wrong.</p>
<p>He tried to speak: &quot;Alex, nooo-&quot;</p>
<p>[CUT TO BLACK]</p>
<p>Next time on Tits for Tates: In a very special episode, the Tate brothers learn the rules of their magical contract. But knowing the rules doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll follow them. Eight complaints down. Twenty-two to go. And sometimes the best defense is a good offense. Don&#39;t miss &quot;Breast Intentions&quot;-next week, same Tate time, same Tate channel!</p>
